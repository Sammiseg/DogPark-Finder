            <h3>1. Make sure you have water and a dog bowl with you</h3>
    <p>
        Dog bowls are very important especially on hot days. filled with water it lets your dog stay hydrated since dogs running around will get dehydrated from exerting themselves to much. If you don't have a waterbowl or water your dog will end up going to anothers water and drinking from that. <br/>Taking that owners water can lead to their dog getting dehydrated. So to keep everyone happy it is best that you bring your own water and bowl.

            <h3>2. Basic obedience</h3>
            <p> Everyone has seen that one dog that is totally out of control. No manners what so ever and doesn't listen to their owner. The dog can sometimes cause fights with other dogs either by being too wound up or not listening to you when you call. </p>
            <p>
            Socializing your dog is very important for your dogs mental health and wellbeing. It also helps them get a feel for where they stand in a pack. Though we all want the best for our dogs, not a lot of us take the time to actually do that. Basic Obedience is great in a dog park if you have them know the leave it and come command at least. Not everyone comes to a dog park with a friendly dog. Some come with aggressive dogs who would rather body slam your dog to the ground and bite them than play a game of chase. That being said there are a few ways to not have that happen</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have your dog know the come and leave it command</li>
                <li>Keep an eye on your dog at all times</li>
                <li>Know your dog</li>
                <li>keep an eye out for aggressive dogs and behaviors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are very important cause with these your dog will be better protected. if your dog shows any signs of aggression <strong>do not</strong> just put a leash on them and think that will work. When a dog shows aggression it is intensified with a leash. It gives them the feeling of being trapped. When your dog is aggressive the best thing for them is to remove them. Let them settle down than bring them back to see if that helped. don't let them in the park, but keep them on the other side of the fence to keep your dog and others dog safe. if he still shows aggression than do some training with them. Every moment is a good time to learn something new.</p>
